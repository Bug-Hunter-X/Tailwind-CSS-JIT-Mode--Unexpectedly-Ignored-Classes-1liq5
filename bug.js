This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt.js and it is related to how Tailwind's JIT mode handles class names.  During the build process, Tailwind generates the CSS based on the classes used in your application. If you use a class that is not defined in your Tailwind configuration, or if there's a typo in a class name, the JIT mode might not recognize it, leading to unexpected results like classes being completely ignored or causing a CSS error during build.
