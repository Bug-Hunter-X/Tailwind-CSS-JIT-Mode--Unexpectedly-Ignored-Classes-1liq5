The solution is simple: carefully review your Tailwind class names for any typos.  Ensure all classes used are correctly defined within your `tailwind.config.js` or are part of the default Tailwind classes.  If using a framework like Next.js, ensure your Tailwind setup is properly configured to work with the framework's build process.  Using linters or IDE extensions that support Tailwind can also significantly reduce these types of errors.
